PhartShield offers real-time protection against pharting attacks and other Internet nasties.

## Features

- PhartShield works offline and your personal data is never transmitted online thereby ensuring your privacy. In an age where various "shields" and "blockers" require connecting to the cloud or signing up for an account, which would knowingly or unknowingly expose your data to unscripulous hackers, PhartShield takes the traditional approach in baking all protection features inside the standalone app.

- PhartShield takes advantage of your bookmarks and history to generate a user profile to determine the likelihood that URLs you are visiting are performing pharting attacks. This personal data is never shared and only exists on your computer. Other "shields" and "blockers" try to generate a generic profile based on their entire user-base which would result in too many false positives because everyone is unique.

- Other "shields" and "blockers" only block potential attacks and don't offer remedies. Users given the choice to continue or stop may be tempted to continue, simply out of inertia. Phart shield allows users to continue using a fake persona so that curious users can satisfy their curiosity while minimizing the risk to them.

- PhartShield offloads the initial pattern matching to the browser to minimize resource usage which helps extend battery life. Only after the browser has found a probably match based on PhartShield's criteria will it call up PhartShield. This helps alleviate concerns that the app is slowing down everything.

- PhartShield conforms to accessibility guidelines and is screen reader ready and keyboard accessible.

- PhartShield's source code is Open Source.

## Why use it?

Pharting is no laughing matter. From something as simple as exposing your private health conditions to something as serious as jeopardizing a multi-million dollar business deal, pharting affects us all in a very personal way. Victims of pharting should not shy away from crowds or attempt to camouflage the ordeal. This will only serve to make pharters more bold. The first step to fixing the problem is accepting that it is a problem. Only then can the healing begin. PhartShield was created to carry this mantle and put the tools into the hands of those who need it.

## Why the name?

We know. Countless people have brought it to our attention that the we should have called it "PhartShield Security Suite" or "PhartShield Origins" but we chose to stick with our gut feeling and call it "PhartShield". Plus "PhartGuard" was already taken and "PhartBlocker" sounds like an unpolished term.
