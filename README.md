PhartShield offers real-time protection against pharting attacks and other Internet nasties.

## Features

- PhartShield works offline and your personal data is never transmitted online thereby ensuring your privacy. In an age where various "shields" and "blockers" require connecting to the cloud or signing up for an account, which would knowingly or unknowingly expose your data to unscripulous hackers, PhartShield takes the traditional approach in baking all protection features inside the standalone app.

- PhartShield takes advantage of your bookmarks and history to generate a user profile to determine the likelihood that URLs you are visiting are performing pharting attacks. This personal data is not shared and only exists on your computer. Other "shields" and "blockers" try to generate a generic profile based on their entire user-base which would result in too many false positives because not everyone is the same.

- Other "shields" and "blockers" only block potential attacks and don't offer remedies. Users given the choice to continue or stop may be tempted to continue, simply out of inertia. Phart shield allows users to continue using a fake persona so that curious users can satisfy their curiosity.

- PhartShield conforms to accessibility guidelines and is screen reader ready and keyboard ready.

- PhartGuard is Open Source.
